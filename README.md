# passthrough_rate
An exploration of internal website traffic in R.

This was a timed exercise that I chose to do with dplyr syntax while I was
learning to use the tidyverse. Usually I use data.table syntax.

This repo does not include the proprietary 2-million record dataset used in
the analysis. Users will not be able to knit the .RMD file without this
dataset, so a fully-knit .html document of the final output is included.
